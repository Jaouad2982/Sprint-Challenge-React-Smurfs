1-
Server side rendering can be a bit faster at the initial request, quite simply because it doesn’t require as many round trips to the server. However it doesn’t end here, performance also depends upon some additional factors. All of which can result in drastically varied user experiences:

The internet speed of the user making the request
How many active users are accessing the site at a given time
The physical location of the server
How optimized the pages are for speed
Etc…
Client side rendering, on the other hand, is slower at initial request because it’s making multiple round trips to the server. However, once these requests are complete, CSR offers a blazing fast experience via the JS framework.
Each one of them has props and cons such as speed and so many others
